Fancy Safari Extension
======================

## What Is It?

A Safari extension for adding things to <a href="http://fancy.com" target="_blank">Fancy</a>

## Why?

Because Fancy doesn't make one, and I don't really like bookmarklets

## How do I install it?

Just <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cam/fancy-it/master/fancy.safariextz" target="_blank">download the compiled plugin</a> and double click the dowloaded file.
